# Dotfiles
This repository contains all my dotfiles. 
It contains of a directory of scripts that get executed which all take part of some aspect of my computer. These all get executed by the [setup.sh](setup.sh) script in the root of the repo. 
I usually just clone this repo in my homefolder and execute the script.
