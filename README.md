# Dotfiles
This repository contains all my dotfiles. 
It contains of a directory of scripts that get executed which all take part of some aspect of my computer. These all get executed by the [setup.sh](setup.sh) script in the root of the repo. 
I usually just clone this repo in my homefolder and execute the script. 

I Currently apply this to two types of systems:
- arch
- termux on android

This system is currently more of a proof of concept and will probably change over time based on my experiences.
